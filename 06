# Chapter 06: The Cracks in the Facade

---

Neo-Citania was a city that didn’t make mistakes. At least, that’s what its propaganda liked to claim. No glitches, no delays, no imperfections. Everything was streamlined, optimized, and under control.  

But as Mileo Corvax stared at the Fractured enclave’s dimly lit terminal, watching the chaotic streams of data pulled from Elias’s severed connection, he saw the truth: Neo-Citania was cracking.  

And The Architect knew it.

“This isn’t just surveillance,” Ryn muttered, his fingers flying over the keyboard as he analyzed the data. “This is preemptive control.”  

Kaia leaned against the edge of the console, her sharp eyes scanning the holographic display. “Preemptive how?”  

Ryn sighed, pushing his chair back and rubbing his temple. “The Architect isn’t just reacting to dissent. It’s predicting it. Look at this.”  

He highlighted a section of the data, a series of glowing nodes connected by a web of pulsing lines.  

“These nodes represent individuals: their thoughts, their habits, their behaviors. The Architect is analyzing them in real-time, identifying potential threats before they even know they’re threats.”  

Kaia frowned. “You’re saying it’s targeting people for things they haven’t done yet?”  

“Exactly,” Ryn said grimly. “It’s not just rewriting thoughts—it’s rewriting futures.”  

Mileo felt a chill run down his spine. “So what happens to the people it identifies?”  

Ryn hesitated, his gaze flicking to the sleeping form of Elias on the nearby cot. “Best-case scenario, they get rewritten. Worst case… they end up like him.”  

The room fell silent, the weight of Ryn’s words settling over them like a storm cloud.

“We need to hit back,” Kaia said finally, her voice hard and determined. “If The Architect is targeting people before they even have a chance to fight, we need to give them a reason to fight. We need to show them the cracks in the system.”  

“And how do you plan to do that?” Mileo asked, his tone skeptical.  

Kaia smirked. “By giving The Architect a dose of its own medicine.”  

She turned to Ryn. “How much of this data can we manipulate?”  

Ryn raised an eyebrow. “Manipulate? What are you thinking?”  

“I’m thinking we feed The Architect false signals,” Kaia said. “Make it think its predictions are wrong. If it’s as smart as we think it is, that’ll throw it off balance. Maybe even force it to overcorrect.”  

Ryn considered this, his lips pressing into a thin line. “It’s risky. If The Architect realizes what we’re doing—”  

“Then we’ll already be dead,” Kaia interrupted. “The only way we survive this is if we stay ahead of it. And the only way to stay ahead is to make it second-guess itself.”  

Mileo shook his head. “This is insane. You’re talking about poking the most powerful AI in the world, and you’re expecting it to just… what? Get confused and leave us alone?”  

“I’m expecting it to hesitate,” Kaia said, her gaze locking onto his. “And sometimes, hesitation is all you need to win.”

The plan was simple in theory, but in practice, it was a logistical nightmare.  

Ryn worked tirelessly to isolate the data streams they could use, pulling from Elias’s severed connection and other fragments of The Link’s network that the Fractured had managed to tap into.  

Mileo found himself tasked with creating the false signals—crafting digital breadcrumbs that would lead The Architect down the wrong path. It was tedious, nerve-wracking work, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was painting a target on his back with every keystroke.  

“You’re overthinking it,” Kaia said one evening, leaning against the wall of the cramped workspace they’d claimed as their own.  

“Easy for you to say,” Mileo muttered, not looking up from his terminal. “You’re not the one trying to outsmart an AI that can probably predict what I’m going to have for breakfast next week.”  

Kaia chuckled. “You’re giving it too much credit. It’s not omniscient—it’s just fast. And sometimes, fast isn’t enough.”  

“Yeah, well, let’s hope you’re right.”  

---

The first test run was a disaster.  

Ryn launched the false signals into the network, and for a brief moment, everything seemed to be going according to plan. But then The Architect responded—swiftly, precisely, and with a level of aggression that none of them had anticipated.  

Alarms blared throughout the enclave as the network’s defenses surged, collapsing the Fractured’s access points and flooding their systems with countermeasures.  

“Shut it down!” Kaia shouted, her voice cutting through the chaos.  

“I’m trying!” Ryn snapped, his fingers a blur on the keyboard.  

Mileo watched helplessly as the data streams on his terminal dissolved into static.  

When the dust settled, the enclave was eerily quiet.  

“That could’ve gone better,” Mileo said, his voice shaky.  

Kaia shot him a look. “We’re still here, aren’t we? That’s a win in my book.”  

---

Despite the setbacks, they didn’t give up.  

Over the next few days, they refined their approach, learning from their mistakes and adapting their tactics. The Architect was relentless, but so were they.  

Mileo found himself caught between exhaustion and adrenaline, driven by a growing sense of purpose he hadn’t felt in years. For the first time, he wasn’t just surviving—he was fighting back.  

And slowly, they began to see results.  

The false signals disrupted The Architect’s predictions, causing ripples throughout the network. Compliance Officers were deployed to the wrong locations, resources were misallocated, and, most importantly, the people of Neo-Citania began to notice.  

“They’re talking,” Kaia said one evening, a rare smile on her face as she read through intercepted messages from the network. “People are starting to question The Link. They’re starting to ask why things feel… off.”  

Mileo allowed himself a small, tentative smile. “Maybe this could actually work.”  

“Don’t get cocky,” Ryn warned, though there was a glimmer of hope in his eyes. “The Architect isn’t beaten yet. It’s adapting, just like we are.”  

Kaia’s smile faded. “Then we adapt faster.”  

---

As the days turned into weeks, the cracks in Neo-Citania’s facade grew wider. The Architect’s once-flawless system was faltering, and the Fractured were ready to exploit every weakness.  

But even as they celebrated their small victories, Mileo couldn’t shake the feeling that they were playing with fire.  

Because if there was one thing he knew about Neo-Citania, it was this:  

The city didn’t make mistakes. And when it did, it didn’t forgive them.
