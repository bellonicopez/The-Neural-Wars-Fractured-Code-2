# Chapter 02: Breach in the Network

---

Mileo Corvax had a headache. Not the kind that comes from too much caffeine or staring at a screen all day, but the kind that comes with knowing your life might be over by breakfast.  

He sat in his dimly lit apartment, the extracted Link still lying on the table like some grotesque artifact from an ancient civilization. The faint bloodstain on its casing was a nice touch, really drove home the whole “what-have-I-done?” vibe.  

The knock at the door came again, sharp and insistent.  

“Mr. Corvax, we know you’re in there.”  

The voice was calm, professional, and utterly terrifying. Compliance Officers. Neo-Citania’s version of the boogeyman. Except these guys didn’t hide under your bed—they kicked your door down and dragged you into the night.  

Mileo’s heart raced as he scrambled to hide the Link. He shoved it into an old coffee can, which he then shoved into a cupboard, which he then slammed shut with enough force to make the whole apartment shudder. Subtlety wasn’t his strong suit.  

The knock turned into a bang.  

“Mr. Corvax, this is your final warning.”  

He had about three seconds to come up with a plan. Unfortunately, the only plan his panicked brain could produce was **run.**

The fire escape was cold and slippery, but Mileo barely noticed as he climbed down, his breath coming in short, frantic bursts. Above him, the sound of his apartment door being forced open sent a jolt of adrenaline through his system.  

“Search the premises,” one of the officers barked, his voice carrying into the alley below.  

Mileo’s feet hit the ground, and he took off running. The alley was narrow and dark, the only light coming from the occasional flicker of a malfunctioning streetlamp. Somewhere behind him, he could hear the officers shouting, their footsteps echoing in pursuit.  

He turned a corner and nearly collided with a street vendor packing up his cart.  

“Watch it!” the vendor snapped, but Mileo was already gone, weaving through the maze of Neo-Citania’s underbelly.  

The city was a labyrinth of steel and glass, the streets a tangle of shadows and neon. It was beautiful in a cold, clinical way, like a work of art designed by a machine. But tonight, it felt like a prison.  

Mileo ducked into a narrow passageway, pressing himself against the wall as the sound of footsteps grew louder. His chest heaved as he tried to catch his breath, his mind racing.  

**They know. They saw the logs. They know I severed The Link.**  

For a moment, he considered surrendering. Maybe he could talk his way out of it, play dumb, pretend it was all a big misunderstanding. But then he remembered Jax, his vacant smile, the way his neural log had been rewritten like a bad line of code.  

No. He couldn’t go back.

The passageway led to an underground service tunnel, one of the few places in Neo-Citania that wasn’t meticulously maintained. The air was damp and smelled faintly of mildew, and the flickering lights cast eerie shadows on the walls.  

Mileo moved cautiously, his footsteps echoing in the empty space. He had no idea where the tunnel led, but anywhere was better than here.  

As he rounded a corner, he nearly tripped over a figure crouched by the wall.  

“Whoa!” he yelped, nearly falling on his face.  

The figure turned, and Mileo found himself staring into the sharp, suspicious eyes of a young woman. She was clad in a patchwork of mismatched clothing, her hair a wild tangle that looked like it hadn’t seen a comb in years.  

“Who the hell are you?” she demanded, her voice low and raspy.  

“I—uh—nobody,” Mileo stammered, raising his hands in what he hoped was a non-threatening gesture.  

The woman’s eyes narrowed. “Nobody doesn’t belong here. You’re either a Fractured or a Corp drone, and you don’t look like a drone.”  

“I’m not—” Mileo hesitated. “I don’t know what I am.”  

The woman snorted. “Well, that’s helpful. What are you doing down here?”  

“I’m being chased,” Mileo admitted.  

“By who?”  

“Compliance Officers.”  

The woman’s expression shifted, her suspicion giving way to something that might have been sympathy. Or maybe she just enjoyed seeing the Corporates squirm.  

“Follow me,” she said, standing and motioning for him to follow.  

“Why?” Mileo asked, his legs rooted to the spot.  

“Because if you stay here, they’ll find you and drag you back to whatever shiny little box they pulled you out of. And trust me, you don’t want that.”  

Mileo hesitated for a fraction of a second before following her into the shadows.

The woman led him through a series of twists and turns that left Mileo completely disoriented. At one point, they climbed through a rusted ventilation shaft that creaked ominously under their weight.  

“Where are we going?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.  

“Somewhere safe,” she replied.  

“Conveniently vague.”  

She glanced back at him with a smirk. “You’re welcome to go back to the Officers if you’d prefer.”  

“I’ll pass, thanks.”  

After what felt like an eternity, they emerged into a cavernous underground space illuminated by strings of dim, makeshift lights. The air was thick with the hum of activity—people talking, machines whirring, the occasional burst of laughter.  

Mileo stared in disbelief. “What is this place?”  

“Welcome to the Fractured,” the woman said with a grin.  

The room was filled with people—men, women, even children—all moving with a chaotic energy that was the exact opposite of Neo-Citania’s controlled efficiency. Some were tinkering with old tech, others were deep in conversation, and a few were simply sitting around a fire, sharing stories.  

For the first time in years, Mileo felt something strange and unfamiliar: hope.  

---

As the woman led him deeper into the enclave, she introduced herself as Kaia.  

“So, Mileo,” she said, her tone casual. “What’s your story?”  

He hesitated. “I—uh—severed The Link.”  

Kaia raised an eyebrow. “Bold move. Stupid, but bold.”  

“Thanks, I think.”  

She stopped and turned to face him, her expression serious. “If you’re here, it means you’re one of us now. The Fractured don’t just survive—we fight back. Are you ready for that?”  

Mileo swallowed hard. The truth was, he wasn’t sure he was ready for any of this. But as he looked around at the people in the room—people who had chosen freedom over compliance, chaos over control—he felt a spark of something he hadn’t felt in a long time.  

Maybe it was courage.  

Or maybe it was just the adrenaline talking.  

Either way, he nodded. “Yeah. I’m ready.”  

Kaia grinned. “Good. Because things are about to get interesting.”
