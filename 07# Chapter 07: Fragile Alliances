# Chapter 07: Fragile Alliances

---

Mileo Corvax was many things—an ex-coder, a reluctant rebel, and, as Kaia liked to point out, a “walking bad decision.” But one thing he definitely wasn’t was a diplomat.  

So, naturally, when Kaia announced that they’d be meeting with another faction of the Fractured to discuss a potential alliance, Mileo’s immediate response was, “Why me?”  

Kaia just grinned and slapped him on the shoulder. “Because you’re charming, Corvax. And because I need someone to carry the gear.”

The meeting point was a derelict subway station, long forgotten by Neo-Citania’s pristine transit system. The air was thick with dust, the faint smell of rust and mildew clinging to the walls.  

Kaia led the way, her weapon slung casually over her shoulder. Mileo followed reluctantly, carrying a heavy satchel filled with supplies.  

“How do you even know these people?” he asked, his voice echoing in the cavernous space.  

“I don’t,” Kaia replied, her tone infuriatingly casual.  

“Wait, what?” Mileo stopped in his tracks. “You’re telling me we’re about to walk into a negotiation with people you’ve never met?”  

Kaia turned to face him, her expression unreadable. “Look, Corvax, this is how it works. The Fractured aren’t exactly a cohesive unit. We’re scattered, disorganized, and paranoid as hell. But if we’re going to stand a chance against The Architect, we need to start working together. And that starts here.”  

Mileo groaned. “Great. So we’re walking into an ambush.”  

“Probably,” Kaia said with a shrug. “But that’s why you brought the gear.”

The other faction arrived shortly after, their footsteps echoing through the abandoned tunnels.  

They were led by a man named Harlan—a tall, broad-shouldered figure with a face that looked like it had been carved from stone. His piercing gray eyes swept over Mileo and Kaia, lingering on the weapon slung over her shoulder.  

“You must be Kaia,” he said, his deep voice carrying an edge of suspicion.  

“And you must be Harlan,” Kaia replied, her own tone sharp enough to cut glass.  

Mileo resisted the urge to groan. This was going well.  

---

The negotiations were… tense, to say the least.  

Harlan’s faction, known as the Iron Veil, was wary of outsiders. They had survived this long by trusting no one, and they weren’t about to change that just because Kaia flashed her trademark smirk and promised unity.  

“We’ve heard about you, Kaia,” Harlan said, his arms crossed over his chest. “You and your little band of rebels, running around, stirring up trouble. But trouble doesn’t win wars. Strategy does.”  

Kaia bristled, her eyes narrowing. “And what’s your strategy, Harlan? Sitting in the shadows, waiting for The Architect to find you? Because let me tell you, hiding isn’t going to save you.”  

Harlan’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t respond immediately. Instead, he turned his gaze to Mileo.  

“And who’s this?” he asked, his tone laced with skepticism. “Your errand boy?”  

Mileo opened his mouth to respond, but Kaia beat him to it.  

“This is Mileo Corvax,” she said, her voice firm. “He severed his Link and lived to tell the tale. He’s the reason we know The Architect is vulnerable. And he’s the reason we’re still standing.”  

Mileo stared at her, caught off guard by the unexpected vote of confidence.  

Harlan raised an eyebrow. “Impressive. But severing a Link doesn’t make you a soldier.”  

“No,” Mileo said, finding his voice. “But it makes me someone who’s willing to fight. And right now, that’s more than most people can say.”

The tension in the room was palpable as the two groups sized each other up. Kaia and Harlan were locked in a silent battle of wills, their stubbornness radiating like heatwaves.  

Finally, Harlan sighed. “Alright, Kaia. You’ve got guts—I’ll give you that. But if we’re going to do this, we do it my way.”  

Kaia’s eyes narrowed. “Your way?”  

Harlan nodded. “We hit The Architect where it hurts. Hard and fast. No more of this subtle disruption nonsense.”  

“And what happens when The Architect retaliates?” Kaia shot back.  

“We deal with it,” Harlan said simply.  

Kaia shook her head. “You’re playing with fire, Harlan. If we’re not careful, we’ll burn ourselves alive.”  

“And if we’re too careful, we’ll die waiting,” Harlan countered.  

---

In the end, they reached a fragile understanding. The Iron Veil would work with Kaia’s group, but only on their own terms. It wasn’t the alliance Kaia had hoped for, but it was better than nothing.  

As they left the subway station, Mileo couldn’t shake the feeling that they had just made a deal with the devil.  

“Do you trust them?” he asked Kaia, breaking the silence.  

She glanced at him, her expression unreadable. “No. But I don’t need to trust them. I just need them to fight.”  

Mileo frowned. “And what happens when this blows up in our faces?”  

Kaia’s smirk returned, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Then we’ll deal with it. Hard and fast.”  

---

The uneasy alliance with the Iron Veil marked a turning point for the Fractured. For the first time, they weren’t just surviving—they were preparing for war.  

But as Mileo watched Kaia disappear into the shadows, he couldn’t help but wonder if they were ready for what was coming.  

Because if there was one thing he had learned about The Architect, it was this:  

It didn’t play fair.  

And it didn’t lose.
