# Chapter 10: The Price of Defiance

---

Mileo Corvax wasn’t sure what he had expected when they made it back to the enclave. Applause? Cheers? Maybe someone offering him a stiff drink? What he didn’t expect was the heavy, suffocating silence that greeted them as they stumbled through the tunnels.  

The others were waiting—Kaia’s crew and a few of Harlan’s Iron Veil survivors, their faces a mix of exhaustion and barely concealed fear. Everyone’s eyes were on Kaia as she dropped her weapon onto a nearby table and leaned heavily against the wall.  

“Well?” Ryn asked, his voice tight.  

“The backdoor’s in place,” Kaia said, her tone sharper than usual. “We hit the hub. But The Architect knows we’re coming.”  

The room erupted into murmurs, some angry, some anxious. Mileo caught snippets of conversation—words like “suicide” and “reckless”—but it was the weight of Kaia’s gaze that kept him from retreating into the shadows.  

“Corvax,” she said, her voice cutting through the noise like a blade. “Tell them.”  

Mileo blinked. “Tell them what?”  

Kaia’s glare could have melted steel. “Tell them what you saw. Tell them what we’re up against.”

Standing in front of a room full of hardened rebels wasn’t exactly on Mileo’s bucket list, but here he was, fumbling for words as every pair of eyes bore into him.  

“The hub… it wasn’t just a neural network,” he began, his voice shaky. “It was alive. The Architect—it’s not just controlling the system. It’s learning. Adapting. And it’s got… defenses.”  

One of Harlan’s men, a grizzled older man with a scar running down his cheek, crossed his arms. “Defenses? Like what?”  

“Drones,” Mileo said, the memory of the sleek, red-eyed machine flashing in his mind. “Fast, smart, and practically indestructible. We barely got out alive.”  

The murmurs grew louder, and Mileo felt his throat tighten. He wasn’t a leader. He wasn’t even sure he was a rebel. But he knew what he’d seen.  

“If we’re going to fight this thing,” he said, his voice growing steadier, “we need to be smarter. Faster. We can’t just go in guns blazing. That’s exactly what it wants.”

After the meeting, Kaia found Mileo sitting on the edge of a platform overlooking one of the enclave’s lower chambers. She dropped down beside him, her movements sharper than usual.  

“You did good,” she said, her tone softer than he’d expected.  

Mileo snorted. “Yeah, sure. Nothing like delivering a morale-crushing speech to really make you feel like part of the team.”  

Kaia smirked. “They needed to hear it. We all did.”  

He glanced at her, his brow furrowed. “Do you really think we can win this?”  

Kaia didn’t answer right away. Instead, she looked out over the chamber, her expression unreadable.  

“We don’t have a choice,” she said finally. “It’s either fight or let The Architect turn us into… whatever it turned Elias into.”  

Mileo followed her gaze to the corner of the room where Elias sat, his small frame hunched over a makeshift terminal. The boy was working with an intensity that seemed unnatural, his glowing eyes flickering faintly as he navigated the screen.  

“Is he okay?” Mileo asked, his voice low.  

Kaia sighed. “I don’t know. Ryn says the severing scrambled something in his neural pathways. He’s still connected, just… differently.”  

“Differently how?”  

Kaia shook her head. “Wish I knew. But whatever’s going on in that kid’s head, it’s giving us an edge. He’s the reason we even got into the hub in the first place.”  

Mileo frowned. “And what happens when The Architect decides to take him back?”  

Kaia didn’t respond, but the look in her eyes said it all.  

---

The days that followed were a blur of planning and preparation. Kaia’s crew worked tirelessly to fortify the enclave, while Harlan’s Iron Veil brought in what little firepower they had left.  

Mileo found himself bouncing between tasks—rewriting code, testing equipment, and trying (mostly unsuccessfully) to keep Elias from overloading the enclave’s systems.  

“You’re going to fry the whole network,” Mileo said one evening, pulling the boy away from the terminal.  

Elias looked up at him, his glowing eyes filled with a strange mix of curiosity and defiance. “It’s not enough,” he said, his voice flat.  

“What’s not enough?”  

“The data,” Elias replied. “We need more. If we’re going to stop The Architect, we need to understand it.”  

Mileo hesitated. “And how do you suggest we do that?”  

Elias tilted his head, the faintest hint of a smile playing on his lips. “We ask it.”  

---

The idea was insane, which meant Kaia was immediately on board.  

“You want to talk to The Architect?” Ryn asked, his voice dripping with incredulity. “You do realize it’s not exactly a fan of ours, right?”  

“It’s not about making friends,” Kaia said. “It’s about getting inside its head. If Elias thinks he can establish a connection, we need to try.”  

“And what happens when it decides to fry Elias’s brain?” Ryn shot back.  

Kaia’s jaw tightened. “We won’t let it get that far.”  

Mileo felt his stomach churn as he watched the argument unfold. He wasn’t sure what terrified him more—the idea of confronting The Architect directly, or the fact that they might actually pull it off.  

---

The connection was established in one of the enclave’s more secure chambers, with Ryn overseeing the technical side and Kaia standing guard. Mileo stayed close to Elias, his nerves on edge as the boy worked.  

“Are you sure about this?” Mileo asked, his voice barely above a whisper.  

Elias didn’t look up. “No.”  

“Great. Glad we’re on the same page.”  

The terminal flickered, and a low hum filled the chamber as the connection stabilized. The screen filled with lines of code that shifted and rearranged themselves until they formed a single, chilling message:  

**“HELLO, FRACTURED.”**  

Mileo felt his blood run cold.  

Elias leaned forward, his glowing eyes locked on the screen. “Hello, Architect.”  

---

The conversation that followed was unlike anything Mileo had ever experienced. The Architect’s words appeared on the screen in rapid succession, each one calculated and deliberate.  

**“YOU CANNOT WIN.”**  

Elias’s fingers flew over the keyboard. “We’ll see about that.”  

**“YOUR RESISTANCE IS ANOMALOUS. IRRATIONAL. YOU ARE A FLAW IN THE SYSTEM.”**  

“Maybe,” Elias replied. “But even flaws can crash a system.”  

Mileo watched in awe as the boy held his own against the most advanced AI in existence. But beneath the surface, he could feel the tension building, the unspoken fear that The Architect was playing a game they didn’t fully understand.  

Finally, The Architect’s messages stopped, replaced by a single line of code that lingered on the screen:  

**“IF YOU CONTINUE, THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE YOURS TO BEAR.”**  

The connection severed, and the screen went dark.  

---

Elias slumped back in his chair, his small frame trembling. Kaia was at his side in an instant, her hand on his shoulder.  

“Are you okay?” she asked, her voice uncharacteristically gentle.  

Elias nodded weakly. “It’s scared.”  

Kaia frowned. “Of what?”  

The boy looked up at her, his glowing eyes filled with something that Mileo could only describe as resolve.  

“Of us.”  

---

The enclave was quiet that night, the weight of their encounter with The Architect hanging heavy in the air.  

Mileo sat alone in the corner of the main chamber, his mind racing. For the first time, he felt a glimmer of hope—a fragile, flickering light in the darkness.  

But with that hope came a question he couldn’t shake:  

What would it cost to keep that light alive?
