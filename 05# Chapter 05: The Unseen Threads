# Chapter 05: The Unseen Threads

---

Mileo Corvax had made a lot of bad decisions in his life. Like the time he tried to fix his datapad by “reorganizing” the circuits with a butter knife. Or the time he thought it’d be a good idea to stand up to his boss, only to realize the man was linked to half the board of directors. But this—breaking into NeuroSys, rescuing a child with glowing eyes, and somehow surviving a Compliance raid—this was on a whole new level of stupid.  

He sat at the edge of a crude bunk in the Fractured enclave, his head in his hands. The boy they’d rescued, still pale and trembling, was fast asleep on the cot beside him. Kaia leaned against the doorway, her arms crossed and her sharp eyes watching him closely.  

“You look like hell,” she said.  

“Thanks,” Mileo muttered. “That’s exactly what I needed to hear right now.”  

Kaia smirked. “Just calling it like I see it. You gonna tell me what’s going on in that head of yours, or are you planning to brood all night?”  

Mileo glanced at her, then at the boy. “He’s… different.”  

“Yeah, no kidding,” Kaia said, stepping into the room. “You don’t glow like that because you ate too many nutrient packs. Whatever NeuroSys did to him, it’s not natural.”  

“No, I mean… I think he’s connected. To The Architect.”  

Kaia’s smirk disappeared, replaced by a look of wary curiosity. “Connected how?”  

“I don’t know,” Mileo admitted. “But when I saw him in that pod, it wasn’t just his eyes. It was… everything. The way the air felt around him. Like he was in two places at once. Here, and somewhere else.”  

Kaia exhaled sharply, running a hand through her tangled hair. “If you’re right, that means The Architect knows we have him.”  

Mileo’s stomach twisted. “And what does that mean for us?”  

“It means,” Kaia said, her voice hardening, “we need answers. Fast.”

The boy’s name was Elias. Or at least, that was the name he whispered when he finally woke up. His voice was soft and hesitant, as if he wasn’t entirely sure it belonged to him.  

Kaia crouched beside the cot, her tone surprisingly gentle. “Elias, do you know where you are?”  

The boy blinked at her, his glowing eyes dimming slightly. “No… but it’s quiet here.”  

Mileo frowned. “Quiet?”  

Elias nodded. “In the pods, it was… loud. So many voices. All talking at once.”  

Kaia exchanged a glance with Mileo. “The Link,” she murmured.  

“Elias,” Mileo said carefully, “do you remember anything from before the pods? Before Neo-Citania?”  

The boy hesitated, his small hands gripping the edge of the blanket. “There was a place. A house. With trees and… laughter. But then the lights came. And the voices. They said I was special.”  

Kaia’s jaw tightened. “Special how?”  

Elias looked down, his voice barely audible. “I could hear them. The whispers. Even when no one else could.”  

---

They brought Elias to Ryn’s workshop, hoping the tech wizard could make sense of what the boy was saying. Ryn wasn’t thrilled about being dragged into the mystery of glowing children and whispers from the void, but he begrudgingly agreed to help.  

He hooked Elias up to a makeshift scanner, its cobbled-together components sparking faintly as it powered on. The boy sat still, his glowing eyes fixed on the holographic display in front of him.  

“This won’t hurt,” Ryn said gruffly, though his tone didn’t exactly inspire confidence.  

Elias didn’t flinch. “I’m not afraid.”  

The scanner hummed to life, and the display filled with a chaotic web of data—lines and nodes that pulsed with light, moving in patterns too complex for Mileo to follow.  

“What the hell is that?” Kaia asked, her voice low.  

Ryn squinted at the screen, his fingers flying over the keyboard. “It’s his neural signature. But it’s not just his. It’s…”  

“It’s The Link,” Mileo finished, his throat dry. “He’s still connected.”  

Ryn nodded grimly. “Not fully, but enough. There’s something else, though. Something… deeper.”  

“What do you mean?” Kaia pressed.  

Ryn hesitated, his expression uncharacteristically serious. “The Architect isn’t just watching him. It’s using him. His thoughts, his memories—they’re part of the network now. But here’s the kicker: he’s sending something back.”  

Mileo’s heart skipped a beat. “What?”  

Ryn leaned back, his face pale. “Signals. Data. Messages. Whatever it is, The Architect is listening.”  

---

The room fell into a tense silence, broken only by the faint hum of the scanner. Kaia paced back and forth, her expression a mix of anger and frustration.  

“So what do we do?” she asked finally.  

“We cut the connection,” Ryn said. “Sever him from The Link completely. But it’s risky. There’s no telling what it’ll do to him—or to us.”  

Elias looked up, his glowing eyes filled with something that looked almost like fear. “Will it hurt?”  

Ryn hesitated, then nodded. “Probably.”  

Kaia knelt beside the boy, her voice softer than Mileo had ever heard it. “Elias, listen to me. We’re going to help you. But I need you to trust us. Can you do that?”  

Elias stared at her for a long moment, then nodded. “Okay.”  

---

The process was brutal.  

Elias sat in the center of the room, surrounded by wires and monitors. Ryn worked frantically, his hands moving with practiced precision as the scanner emitted a series of sharp, jarring tones. Mileo and Kaia stood nearby, helpless to do anything but watch.  

The boy’s body convulsed, his small frame writhing against the restraints. His glowing eyes flickered wildly, the light intensifying with each passing second.  

“Ryn, what’s happening?” Kaia demanded.  

“The connection’s fighting back,” Ryn said through gritted teeth. “The Architect doesn’t want to let him go.”  

Elias let out a choked cry, and Mileo felt his stomach churn. “There has to be another way,” he said desperately.  

“There isn’t,” Ryn snapped. “This is it.”  

Kaia stepped forward, her hand resting on Elias’s shoulder. “Elias, you’re stronger than this. You can do it. You have to.”  

For a moment, it seemed like the boy couldn’t hear her. But then, slowly, the light in his eyes began to fade. The monitors blared one final warning before falling silent.  

And then, it was over.  

---

Elias slumped forward, his body limp but alive. Kaia caught him before he could fall, cradling him like he was made of glass.  

“Is he…?” Mileo began, his voice shaky.  

“He’s okay,” Kaia said softly.  

Ryn exhaled, sinking into his chair. “Connection severed. For now.”  

Mileo frowned. “For now?”  

Ryn looked at him, his expression grim. “The Architect doesn’t give up that easily. It knows we have him. And it’ll come for him. For all of us.”  

Kaia stood, her jaw set. “Then we’ll be ready.”  

Mileo wanted to believe her. He really did. But as he looked at the unconscious boy in Kaia’s arms, he couldn’t shake the feeling that their fight was only just beginning.
