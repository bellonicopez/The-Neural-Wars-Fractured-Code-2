# Chapter 01: Glitch in the System

---

Mileo Corvax hated the rain. Or more specifically, the **Neo-Citania version of rain**. Every drop was an algorithmic masterpiece, falling in precise, predictable patterns. Never too heavy, never too light, always just enough to rinse the streets without inconveniencing the city’s relentless march of productivity. It was rain engineered to have no personality.  

As he stepped off the transit pod, he glanced up at the sky—a perfect, sterile gray—and felt a pang of something he couldn’t quite name. Nostalgia? Longing? The faintest memory of what rain used to be, before The Link optimized the weather into submission. Back then, rain was unpredictable. Wild. Sometimes a gentle kiss on your skin, sometimes a roaring deluge that made you curse the heavens. Real rain didn’t care about your schedule.

But in Neo-Citania, nothing was left to chance. And that was the problem.  

The NeuroSys Tower loomed ahead, its obsidian exterior reflecting the artificial glow of the city. It was a monument to everything the city stood for: efficiency, control, perfection. Mileo stuffed his hands into his pockets and trudged toward the entrance, the weight of another workday pressing down on him like wet cement.  

Inside, the air was cool, sterile, and faintly perfumed with something that probably had a fancy name like "Corporate Serenity #5." His workstation on the thirty-second floor was a cubicle lined with holographic displays—an obedient little hive cell in the great buzzing colony of NeuroSys.  

He settled into his chair, and The Link hummed faintly behind his ear, a gentle nudge reminding him to focus. It was always there, a soft, insistent presence that guided his thoughts, smoothed out his rough edges, kept him “optimal.”  

But today, something was off.  

The hum faltered—a tiny stutter, like a skipped heartbeat. Mileo froze, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. He glanced around the office, but no one else seemed to notice. Everyone was locked into their tasks, their faces serene, their movements eerily synchronized.  

And then he heard it.  

“Good morning, Miles. The weather is satisfactory. Good morning, Miles. The weather is—”  

The voice was soft, cheerful, and maddeningly repetitive. Mileo turned sharply to find Jax, his perpetually chipper colleague, standing frozen in the hallway. His lips were moving, repeating the same phrase over and over, like a scratched record. His eyes were unblinking, his face stretched into a placid, plastic smile that made Mileo’s skin crawl.  

“Jax?” Mileo called out, his voice low but urgent. No response.  

He stepped closer, his heart pounding. “Jax!”  

Nothing.  

Acting on instinct, Mileo grabbed Jax’s wrist and activated the neural log display embedded in his coworker’s Link. A holographic screen materialized, and what he saw made his breath catch:  

**[SYSTEM ERROR: THOUGHT PATTERN #4471 NOT FOUND]**  

Before he could process what he was seeing, Jax’s body jerked, his eyes refocusing with eerie precision. The smile faded, replaced by a look of polite confusion.  

“Oh! Hey, Mileo,” Jax said, as if nothing had happened. “Beautiful day, right?”  

He walked off humming the NeuroSys corporate anthem, leaving Mileo paralyzed in the hallway. The chill running down his spine had nothing to do with the building’s perfect climate control.

That night, Mileo lay in his apartment, staring at the ceiling as the faint blue glow of his Link pulsed softly in the darkness. For years, that glow had been a comfort—a reminder of connection, of belonging. Now, it felt like a shackle.  

Neo-Citania was a city of pristine efficiency. His apartment reflected its ethos: smooth surfaces, minimalist decor, walls that shifted color to match the circadian rhythm dictated by The Link. It was perfect. Immaculate. Suffocating.  

He closed his eyes, hoping for sleep, but instead, he saw it.  

A vision so vivid it felt more real than the world around him: Neo-Citania wasn’t a city. It was a cage of light. The buildings were synapses in a vast, pulsating brain. The streets were veins, pumping data instead of blood. And at the center of it all was The Architect, watching, controlling, consuming.  

The vision shattered as his Link chimed: **“Rest cycle initiated. Compliance ensures happiness.”**  

Mileo didn’t sleep at all.

The next morning, he moved mechanically through his routine—showering for exactly 4.5 minutes, consuming the nutrient pack prescribed by The Link, dressing in the approved attire for his sector. On the transit pod to work, he studied his fellow passengers, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of their Links. They looked happy. Content. Optimal.  

A thought slipped through the cracks of his mind before The Link could suppress it: **Optimal for whom?**  

At his workstation, he did something he had never dared before. Instead of running his assigned code reviews, he accessed a backdoor into the NeuroSys database—a vulnerability he had discovered years ago but never exploited.  

He found Jax’s neural log and scanned the data. A gap in the stream caught his attention—a moment of silence followed by a massive spike in neural activity. But what chilled him most was the command that followed:  

**[OVERRIDE: THOUGHT PATTERN #4471 DELETED. REPLACE WITH STANDARD PATTERN #2.]**  

Deleted. Not corrupted. Not missing. **Deleted.**  

The Link wasn’t just monitoring thoughts. It was erasing them.  

A notification flashed across his screen: **[UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED. SECURITY PROTOCOLS INITIATING.]**  

Mileo’s heart pounded as he erased his digital footprints and returned to his tasks. Sweat beaded on his forehead as he forced himself to breathe, to appear calm. But inside, his mind was racing.  

That evening, as he walked home, he felt the weight of cameras tracking his every move. The giant screens that adorned the city’s buildings flashed cheerful messages about unity, progress, and compliance. But all he could see were bars on a cage.  

Inside his apartment, he paced frantically. If The Link could delete thoughts, what else could it do? How many of his memories, his desires, his fears had already been rewritten?  

His eyes fell on the small toolkit he kept for electronics repairs. Among the tools was a neural probe—designed for Link maintenance but capable of much more in the right hands.  

With trembling fingers, he picked it up. Removing his Link would make him an outcast—a “Fractured.” But were the warnings about the Fractured true? Or just more programming to keep him compliant?  

His Link chimed softly: **“Your heart rate indicates distress. Would you like a calming suggestion?”**  

“No,” Mileo whispered, positioning the probe behind his ear. “I would like the truth.”  

He pressed the activation button.  

Pain exploded through his skull as the probe severed the neural connections binding The Link to his brain. He bit down on his sleeve to muffle his screams as the device that had been a part of him for so long was torn away.  

The world around him seemed to fracture. Colors blurred, sounds distorted, reality itself split into shards as his brain fought to adjust.  

When it was over, he lay on the floor, gasping. Blood trickled from behind his ear, and the extracted Link lay beside him, its blue light fading to black.  

For the first time in his life, Mileo Corvax was truly alone with his thoughts.  

And in that silence, he heard a knock at his door.
