# Chapter 03: Shadow Signals

---

Mileo Corvax had always thought of Neo-Citania as a machine. Not metaphorically, but literally—a massive, humming contraption where every person, every building, every blinking light was just another cog in the system. But here, deep in the Fractured enclave, the city felt... alive. Messy, chaotic, unpredictable. It was exhilarating. And terrifying.  

Kaia led him through the bustling underground network, her boots crunching on the gravel floor. Around them, Fractured citizens moved with purpose, each immersed in tasks that ranged from the mundane—sewing tattered clothing—to the extraordinary—hacking into NeuroSys mainframes.  

“So, this is it?” Mileo asked, his voice tinged with disbelief. “This is the rebellion?”  

Kaia shot him a sideways glance. “What were you expecting? Capes and secret lairs? Maybe a dramatic logo?”  

“I don’t know… maybe something a little more… organized?”  

She snorted. “We’re not a startup, Corvax. We’re survivors. Organization isn’t exactly a luxury we can afford.”  

They stopped in front of a rusted metal door. Kaia knocked twice, then three times, then once more, the rhythm deliberate. A moment later, the door creaked open to reveal a man who looked like he hadn’t slept in a decade.  

“This him?” the man asked, his voice gravelly.  

“This is him,” Kaia replied. “Mileo Corvax, freshly unlinked and already wanted by Compliance.”  

The man’s tired eyes appraised Mileo, lingering on the faint scar behind his ear where the Link had been removed.  

“Bold move,” he said, stepping aside. “Stupid, but bold.”  

“Yeah, I’m getting that a lot lately,” Mileo muttered as he followed them inside.

The room was dimly lit, the air thick with the scent of solder and burnt circuits. Tables were piled high with wires, tools, and fragments of old technology. A group of Fractured sat around a holographic display, their faces illuminated by its soft blue glow.  

“This is Ryn,” Kaia said, gesturing to the man who had opened the door. “He’s our tech wizard. If it’s broken, he can fix it. If it’s not broken, he can probably still fix it, but it’ll cost you.”  

Ryn grunted in acknowledgment, his focus already back on the tangled mess of circuits in front of him.  

“And this,” Kaia continued, pointing to the holographic display, “is what we’ve been working on.”  

Mileo stepped closer, his eyes widening as he took in the image. It was a map of Neo-Citania, but not the sanitized, official version he was used to. This map was alive with data—glowing lines representing signal flows, blinking dots marking neural hubs, and red zones indicating areas of heavy surveillance.  

“What is this?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.  

“Shadow signals,” Kaia replied. “Every time someone severs their Link, it creates a ripple in the network. A gap. A shadow. We’ve been mapping them, tracking the signals that slip through the cracks.”  

Mileo frowned. “Signals? From where?”  

“From them,” Ryn said, finally looking up from his work.  

“Them?”  

“The Fractured who didn’t make it,” Kaia said quietly. “The ones Compliance caught. Their Links may be gone, but their thoughts… their memories… they’re still out there. Trapped in the system.”  

Mileo felt a chill run down his spine. “You’re saying… their minds are still active?”  

“Barely,” Ryn replied. “But enough to send out a signal. A cry for help.”  

Kaia leaned against the table, her expression grim. “We think The Architect is using them. Experimenting on them. Whatever it’s planning, it’s big. And it’s bad.”

Mileo stared at the map, his mind racing. He had always known The Link was invasive, but this… this was something else.  

“Why are you showing me this?” he asked finally.  

Kaia’s eyes met his, her gaze steady. “Because you’re one of us now. And because we need your help.”  

“Me? What can I possibly do?”  

“You worked for NeuroSys,” Ryn said. “You know their systems, their protocols. You can get us in.”  

Mileo shook his head, panic rising in his chest. “No. No way. I’m not some kind of spy. I’m just a coder. I don’t even know how I got this far without getting caught.”  

“You got this far because you’re smart,” Kaia said. “And because you’re desperate. That’s all we need.”  

“I…” Mileo hesitated, his thoughts a jumble of fear and doubt. “I’m not a fighter.”  

Kaia smiled faintly. “Neither are we. But sometimes, you don’t get to choose.”

The conversation was interrupted by a sudden commotion outside. Shouts echoed through the tunnels, followed by the sound of running footsteps.  

Kaia’s expression hardened. “Stay here,” she ordered, grabbing a makeshift weapon—a length of pipe wrapped in barbed wire—and heading for the door.  

“What’s going on?” Mileo demanded, his voice rising.  

“Trouble,” Ryn said, already packing up his tools. “And if you’re smart, you’ll do exactly what she says.”  

But Mileo wasn’t feeling particularly smart. Against his better judgment, he followed Kaia into the tunnel, his heart pounding.  

The scene outside was chaos. Fractured citizens were scattering in all directions as Compliance Officers swarmed the area, their black uniforms blending into the shadows.  

Kaia swung her weapon with a ferocity that took Mileo by surprise, taking down one officer before turning to face another.  

“Corvax!” she shouted over the noise. “Get back inside!”  

Mileo hesitated, torn between fear and the faintest spark of courage. Then he saw her—Kaia, outnumbered and cornered, her weapon knocked from her hands.  

Before he could think, he was moving. He grabbed a loose pipe from the ground and charged, his grip tight and his breath ragged.  

The officer turned just in time to see Mileo swing. The impact sent the man sprawling, his helmet clattering to the ground.  

Kaia stared at Mileo, her expression a mix of shock and… was that respect?  

“Not bad, Corvax,” she said, retrieving her weapon. “Not bad at all.”  

Mileo didn’t have time to respond before another officer lunged at him, and the fight continued.

By the time the dust settled, the Compliance Officers had retreated, and the Fractured were regrouping.  

Mileo leaned against the tunnel wall, his chest heaving. His hands were shaking, his knuckles raw from the fight.  

Kaia approached him, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “Looks like you’re a fighter after all.”  

“Yeah, well,” Mileo said, wiping the sweat from his brow, “I think I liked it better when I wasn’t.”  

Kaia laughed, the sound surprisingly warm in the aftermath of chaos.  

“Come on,” she said, clapping him on the shoulder. “We’ve got work to do.”  

And as Mileo followed her back into the enclave, he couldn’t help but feel that, for better or worse, his life had just changed forever.
