# Chapter 04: The Architect's Whispers

---

Mileo Corvax wasn’t sure what was worse: the silence of his own thoughts or the growing realization that someone—or something—had been listening to them all along.  

He sat at the edge of a crude steel platform, dangling his legs over the abyss of the Fractured enclave’s lower levels. Below him, the labyrinth of tunnels buzzed with activity: the hum of makeshift generators, the chatter of resistance fighters, the occasional laugh of children who somehow found joy in this underground chaos.  

In another life, he might have envied their resilience. In this one, he just felt tired.  

“You look like you’re thinking too hard.”  

Kaia’s voice pulled him back to reality. She leaned against a nearby beam, her arms crossed and her ever-present smirk firmly in place.  

“Isn’t that the point of severing The Link?” Mileo replied. “To get my thoughts back?”  

“Sure,” Kaia said, pushing off the beam and walking toward him. “But you gotta pace yourself. Too much thinking too fast, and you’ll short-circuit. Trust me, I’ve seen it happen.”  

Mileo raised an eyebrow. “Is that supposed to be comforting?”  

“Not really,” she admitted, plopping down beside him. “But hey, you survived your first Compliance raid. That’s something.”  

“Barely,” he muttered, rubbing the raw skin on his knuckles.  

Kaia studied him for a moment, her smirk fading. “You did good back there, Corvax. Better than I expected.”  

“High praise,” he said dryly.  

She laughed, a sound that felt strangely out of place in the grim surroundings. “Don’t let it go to your head. You’re still a rookie. But rookies can learn.”  

---

Their conversation was interrupted by a sharp whistle from Ryn, who stood on a raised platform a few levels above them.  

“Kaia! Corvax! Get up here. Now.”  

Kaia groaned. “And here I was, enjoying our little heart-to-heart.”  

Mileo followed her up the rickety metal stairs, his curiosity outweighing his exhaustion.  

Ryn was hunched over a console, his fingers flying across the keyboard. The holographic map of Neo-Citania flickered to life, its glowing lines and dots even more chaotic than before.  

“What’s going on?” Kaia asked, her tone all business.  

“We’ve got a signal,” Ryn replied, his voice tense. “A strong one. Coming from Sector 4.”  

Kaia frowned. “Sector 4? That’s deep in NeuroSys territory. What kind of signal?”  

Ryn hesitated, his eyes flicking to Mileo. “A whisper.”  

Mileo’s stomach dropped. “A… whisper?”  

Kaia glanced at him, her expression unreadable. “You know what that means, right?”  

“It means someone’s alive,” Mileo said, his voice barely above a whisper.  

“Not just alive,” Ryn corrected. “Active. Whoever it is, they’re fighting back. Sending out bursts of data, trying to make contact.”  

Kaia leaned over the console, her brow furrowed. “Can we trace it?”  

“Already did,” Ryn said, pulling up a new display. “It’s coming from a NeuroSys facility on the outskirts of Sector 4. High security, heavy surveillance. Definitely not a place you just stroll into.”  

“Which means we’re going in,” Kaia said, her tone leaving no room for argument.  

Mileo’s eyes widened. “Wait, what? We? As in… me?”  

Kaia smirked. “You catch on fast, Corvax.”  

---

The plan was reckless, which Kaia assured him was par for the course. They would infiltrate the facility under the cover of darkness, locate the source of the signal, and extract whoever—or whatever—was sending it.  

“Simple,” Kaia had said with a grin.  

Mileo wasn’t convinced.  

They moved through the tunnels in near silence, their footsteps muffled by the damp earth. Ryn had provided them with a rough layout of the facility, along with a few tools that he claimed would “probably” work.  

“Just don’t drop them,” he had warned. “They’re not exactly… tested.”  

Great, Mileo thought. Nothing like untested tech to inspire confidence.  

---

When they reached the surface, the air was sharp and cold, a stark contrast to the stifling warmth of the tunnels. Neo-Citania’s skyline loomed in the distance, a jagged silhouette of steel and glass against the starless sky.  

Kaia led the way, her movements swift and precise. Mileo followed, doing his best to keep up without tripping over his own feet.  

The facility was a monolithic structure surrounded by a high, electrified fence. Cameras dotted the perimeter, their red lights blinking like watchful eyes.  

“Ryn wasn’t kidding about the security,” Mileo muttered.  

Kaia shot him a look. “Stay focused. We’ve got one shot at this.”  

---

Getting past the fence was the easy part—Ryn’s untested tech worked, much to Mileo’s surprise. Inside, the facility was a maze of sterile hallways and locked doors. Kaia navigated it like she had been there before, her confidence both reassuring and unnerving.  

They reached the source of the signal without incident, but what they found stopped Mileo in his tracks.  

The room was filled with rows of pods, each one glowing faintly. Inside the pods were people—dozens of them—connected to The Link by a web of wires and tubes.  

Kaia’s jaw tightened. “Damn it.”  

“What is this?” Mileo asked, his voice shaking.  

“Storage,” she said bitterly. “NeuroSys’s version of a junk drawer. These are the Fractured they’ve caught. The ones they couldn’t rewrite, so they just… shelved them.”  

Mileo felt sick. “And the signal?”  

Kaia pointed to a pod at the far end of the room. “There.”  

They approached cautiously, and as they got closer, Mileo saw that the occupant of the pod was a young boy, no older than ten. His face was pale, his body thin and frail, but his eyes… his eyes were open, flickering with a faint, unnatural glow.  

“He’s awake,” Mileo whispered.  

Kaia nodded grimly. “And he’s the one sending the signal.”  

---

Ryn’s tools made quick work of the pod’s locks, and soon the boy was free. He clung to Kaia, his small frame trembling against her.  

“We need to move,” Kaia said, her voice urgent. “Now.”  

But as they turned to leave, the room filled with a low, mechanical hum. The lights flickered, and a voice echoed through the facility.  

“Unauthorized access detected. Compliance Officers dispatched.”  

Mileo’s blood ran cold.  

“Run,” Kaia said, her grip tightening on the boy. “Run!”  

They sprinted through the hallways, the sound of approaching footsteps growing louder with each passing second. Mileo’s heart pounded, his breath coming in short, ragged gasps.  

As they neared the exit, a shadow loomed ahead. A Compliance Officer stepped into their path, his weapon raised.  

Kaia didn’t hesitate. She charged, her makeshift weapon swinging with brutal precision. The officer went down, but more were closing in.  

“Go!” she shouted, shoving Mileo toward the exit.  

He didn’t look back.  

---

By the time they reached the tunnels, Mileo’s legs felt like jelly. He collapsed against the wall, gasping for air. Kaia wasn’t far behind, the boy still clinging to her like a lifeline.  

“Well,” she said, her voice strained but steady. “That could’ve gone worse.”  

Mileo stared at her, incredulous. “Worse? How could it possibly have gone worse?”  

Kaia grinned. “You could be dead.”  

Despite himself, Mileo laughed—a shaky, breathless laugh that turned into a cough.  

As the adrenaline began to fade, he glanced at the boy, who was now asleep in Kaia’s arms.  

“What are we going to do with him?” he asked.  

Kaia’s expression softened. “We’ll figure it out. We always do.”  

And as they disappeared back into the shadows, Mileo couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning.
