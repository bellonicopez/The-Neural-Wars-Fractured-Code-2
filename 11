# Epilogue: The Edge of Tomorrow

---

Neo-Citania was quiet. Too quiet.  

The usual hum of the city—the soft buzz of The Link, the rhythmic pulse of data flowing through its veins—was gone. In its place was an eerie stillness, like the moment before a storm.  

Mileo Corvax stood on the rooftop of an old, crumbling building on the outskirts of the city, staring at the skyline. The lights of the towers flickered faintly, their glow dimmer than he remembered. The Architect was still alive—still watching—but it was weaker now.  

They had done that.  

Not defeated it, not yet. But they had shaken it, cracked its perfect facade.  

“You alright, Corvax?”  

Kaia’s voice pulled him from his thoughts. He turned to see her leaning against the doorway, her ever-present weapon slung over one shoulder. She looked tired—more tired than he’d ever seen her—but there was a spark in her eyes that hadn’t been there before.  

“Yeah,” he said, his voice quieter than he’d intended. “Just… thinking.”  

Kaia stepped onto the roof, the wind catching her hair as she joined him at the edge. “That’s a dangerous habit.”  

Mileo smiled faintly. “So I’ve heard.”

The victory at the neural hub had come at a cost. The Fractured had lost people—good people—and the enclave was still reeling from the aftermath.  

But it wasn’t just about survival anymore. For the first time, they had hope.  

Elias had been instrumental in their success, his connection to The Architect proving to be both a blessing and a curse. The boy was resting now, his small frame curled up in one of the safer corners of the enclave.  

Mileo didn’t know what the future held for Elias, or for any of them. But he knew one thing: they couldn’t stop now.  

“This isn’t over,” he said, his gaze fixed on the city.  

Kaia nodded. “No, it’s not. But we’ve got momentum. And that’s something.”  

“You really think we can win?”  

Kaia smirked. “I think we have to try. And if we go down, we go down swinging.”

The wind picked up, carrying with it the faint scent of rain. Mileo closed his eyes, letting the cool air wash over him.  

When he opened them, Kaia was watching him, her expression softer than usual.  

“You did good, Corvax,” she said.  

He snorted. “Don’t let Ryn hear you say that. He might think you’re going soft.”  

Kaia laughed, the sound genuine and warm. “Ryn can think whatever he wants. You earned your place here. Don’t forget that.”  

Mileo didn’t respond, but her words stayed with him as they stood together, watching the city.

Far below, the lights of Neo-Citania flickered again, a reminder that The Architect was still out there, still scheming.  

But for the first time, Mileo didn’t feel afraid.  

He felt ready.  

---

The fight wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.  

But on the edge of tomorrow, with the city stretched out before them and the storm still brewing, Mileo Corvax felt something he hadn’t felt in a long time.  

He felt alive.
