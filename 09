# Chapter 09: Into the Lion’s Den

---

Mileo Corvax had never been a fan of plans. Plans made promises, and promises had a nasty habit of falling apart under pressure. But as he stood in the shadow of the neural hub’s towering structure, clutching the datapad that held their fragile hopes, he realized this wasn’t just a plan. This was a gamble.  

“You good, Corvax?” Kaia’s voice pulled him from his thoughts.  

He glanced at her. She was calm, or at least pretending to be, her weapon slung casually over her shoulder. Behind her, the rest of the team moved in tense silence, their faces a mix of determination and dread.  

“Yeah,” Mileo lied. “I’m good.”  

Kaia smirked. “Sure you are. Just don’t trip over your own feet, alright? We can’t afford to lose you.”  

“Thanks for the pep talk,” he muttered, shifting the datapad to his other hand.  

---

The entrance to the neural hub was a sleek, seamless wall of steel and glass, lit by the faint glow of embedded LEDs. Cameras dotted the perimeter, their lenses scanning methodically for anything out of place.  

“Alright,” Ryn whispered, crouching behind a crumbling concrete barrier. “The cameras are on a ten-second rotation. We time it right, we’re in without being seen.”  

Kaia nodded. “Mileo, you’re up. Get us through the door.”  

Mileo swallowed hard, his heart pounding as he crept toward the entrance. His fingers trembled slightly as he connected the datapad to the security panel, the device emitting a soft hum as it went to work.  

“Any day now, Corvax,” Kaia muttered from behind him.  

“Working on it,” he hissed, his eyes locked on the screen.  

The datapad’s progress bar inched forward, each second feeling like an eternity. Finally, with a soft beep, the panel flashed green.  

“We’re in,” Mileo said, stepping back as the door slid open.  

Kaia clapped him on the shoulder as she passed. “Not bad, Corvax. Not bad at all.”

The interior of the hub was a stark contrast to the gritty chaos of the Fractured enclave. Everything was pristine, the walls and floors gleaming under the harsh white light. The air was cool and sterile, carrying a faint hum that seemed to seep into Mileo’s bones.  

“Stay sharp,” Kaia whispered, her eyes scanning the corridor ahead. “This place is crawling with security.”  

They moved quickly and quietly, sticking to the shadows as they navigated the labyrinthine halls. The neural hub was alive with activity, its systems pulsing with data that flowed like blood through a digital circulatory system.  

Mileo couldn’t help but feel a pang of awe—and fear—at the sheer scale of it all. This was The Architect’s heart, the center of its power. And they were walking straight into it.  

---

The control room was their target—a small, heavily secured chamber buried deep within the hub. It was here that the network’s defenses were managed, and it was here that Mileo would plant the backdoor.  

“Two guards,” Kaia whispered as they approached the door. She nodded to one of the team members, a wiry man named Felix. “You’re up.”  

Felix nodded, slipping silently toward the guards. A moment later, there was a soft thud as one of them crumpled to the ground, followed quickly by the other.  

“Clear,” Felix whispered.  

Kaia motioned for the team to move in.  

---

The control room was a dizzying array of monitors and consoles, each one displaying streams of data that shifted and pulsed in hypnotic patterns.  

Mileo set to work immediately, plugging the datapad into the main console. The screen lit up with lines of code, and he began navigating the system, his fingers flying over the keyboard.  

“Come on, come on,” he muttered under his breath, his pulse racing.  

“Corvax,” Kaia said, her tone sharp. “We’ve got company.”  

Mileo glanced over his shoulder to see Kaia and Felix holding off a pair of Compliance Officers who had appeared at the door.  

“I need more time!” he said, turning back to the console.  

“Then work faster,” Kaia snapped, firing a shot that sent one of the officers sprawling.  

---

The datapad beeped, signaling that the backdoor was in place.  

“Got it!” Mileo said, disconnecting the device.  

“Good,” Kaia said, grabbing him by the arm. “Now let’s get the hell out of here.”  

They bolted from the room, the sounds of alarms and shouting echoing around them. The hub had come alive, its systems reacting to the intrusion with a precision that was both impressive and terrifying.  

“This way!” Kaia shouted, leading the team down a side corridor.  

Mileo followed, his heart pounding as they navigated the maze-like halls. He could hear the heavy footsteps of Compliance Officers behind them, growing louder with each passing second.  

“Almost there!” Kaia said, her voice strained.  

---

The exit was in sight when a figure stepped into their path.  

It wasn’t a Compliance Officer. It wasn’t even human.  

The drone was sleek and menacing, its metallic frame glinting under the harsh light. Its single, glowing red eye locked onto them, and Mileo felt a wave of dread wash over him.  

“Run!” Kaia shouted, firing at the drone.  

The shot glanced off its armor, leaving only a faint scorch mark. The drone retaliated with a burst of energy that sent Felix flying into the wall.  

Mileo froze, his mind racing. This wasn’t part of the plan. They weren’t supposed to face something like this.  

“Corvax, move!” Kaia yelled, grabbing him by the arm and pulling him forward.  

---

They made it out of the hub, but just barely.  

The team was battered and shaken, their breaths coming in ragged gasps as they collapsed behind a crumbling wall a safe distance from the hub.  

“What the hell was that?” Mileo demanded, his hands still shaking.  

“The Architect’s new toy,” Kaia said, her voice grim. “And if they’ve got one, they’ve got more.”  

Ryn’s voice crackled over the comms. “Did you plant the backdoor?”  

“Yeah,” Mileo said, his voice hollow. “But I don’t know if it’s going to be enough.”  

Kaia placed a hand on his shoulder, her grip firm. “It’s a start. And right now, that’s all we’ve got.”  

Mileo nodded, though the knot of fear in his chest remained.  

The tide was shifting, but whether it was in their favor or The Architect’s, he couldn’t yet tell.
